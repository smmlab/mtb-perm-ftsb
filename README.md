Some scripts for reproducing analysis and subfigures in the paper require addition microscopy and molecular dynamics data, which can be obtained from this [Zenodo archive](https://zenodo.org/doi/10.5281/zenodo.13629278).

All analysis in version 2 of the associated preprint corresponds to the state of this repository in [this release](https://github.com/smmlab/mtb-perm-ftsb/tree/manuscript-update).
