\abstract{Latent infection by \mtbfull{} impedes effective tuberculosis therapy and eradication. The protein PerM is essential for chronic \mtb{} infections in mice and acts via the divisome protein FtsB to modulate cell division. Using transgenic co-expression in \ecfull{}, we studied the \mtb{} PerM-FtsB interaction in isolation from other \mtb{} proteins, engineering PerM to enhance expression in the \ec{} membrane. We confirmed the reported instability of \mtb{} FtsB and linked FtsB instability to a segment of FtsB predicted to bind cell-division proteins FtsL and FtsQ. Though narrowly conserved, the FtsB-PerM interaction emerges as a potential target as part of therapy targeting persistent infections by disregulating cell division. Using fluorescence microscopy, we found that the stability of both FtsB and PerM hinges on their interaction via a C-terminal helix in FtsB. Molecular dynamics results supported the observation that FtsB stabilized PerM, and suggested that interactions at the PerM-FtsB interface differ from our initial structure prediction in a way that is consistent with PerM sequence conservation. Integrating protein structure prediction, molecular dynamics and single-molecule microscopy, our approach is primed to screen potential inhibitors of the PerM-FtsB interaction and can be straightforwardly adapted to explore other putative interactions.}

\section{Introduction}\label{sec1}

\mtbfull{} is a major contributor to preventable deaths by infectious disease and has infected approximately a quarter of the global population \citep{houbenGlobalBurdenLatent2016}. Most infections progress to latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI), characterized by an immunological response to \mtb{} antigens without clinical signs of active TB \citep{whoLatentTuberculosisInfection2018}. Preventing establishment and reactivation of LTBI is a growing priority for TB elimination strategies, although uncertainties continue to limit measurements of the relative burdens of new TB infections and LTBI reactivation \citep{daleQuantifyingRatesLate2021}. Protocols that reduce the duration and adverse effects of treatment can reduce LTBI burden by improving upon completion rates for preventative treatment \citep{assefaEfficacySafetyDifferent2023}. Furthermore, imperfect treatment over long periods can contribute to acquisition of drug resistance \citep{liAcquiredResistanceIsoniazid2021}. Consequently, it is imperative to better understand how \mtb{} infections persist to establish LTBI to inform strategies for novel LTBI treatments with higher efficacy, shorter durations, and reduced risk of drug resistance.

A potential strategy to prevent establishment and reactivation of LTBI is to characterize and target mechanisms through which \mtb{} persists through host-induced stress \citep{dartoisAntituberculosisTreatmentStrategies2022}. The actinomycete protein PerM was one of 21 genes identified in a screen of transposon \mtb{} mutants with attenuated growth at pH~$4.5$ in media containing Tween 80, with most of the identified genes being associated with cell wall synthesis \citep{vandalMembraneProteinPreserves2008}. A subsequent study focused on PerM, finding that Mtb PerM knockout reduced growth during chronic mouse infection and increased $\beta$-lactam antibiotic susceptibility. Localization of fluorescently tagged PerM to dividing septa suggested a connection to cell division \citep{goodsmithDisruptionTuberculosisMembrane2015}. Further work demonstrated that PerM associates with the Mtb divisome, a protein complex orchestrating cell wall remodeling during division, and that PerM depletion can be complemented by overexpression of the divisome component FtsB \citep{wangPersistentMycobacteriumTuberculosis2019}. PerM was also recently identified by transposon sequencing to play an even more significant role in infecting mice in a background with weakened adaptive immune response \citep{meadeGenomewideScreenIdentifies2023}.

Recently, a covalent inhibitor of divisome formation based upon the structure of FtsB-FtsQ was developed and found to be active in vivo against drug-resistant \ec{} \citep{paulussenCovalentProteomimeticInhibitor2022}. The \mtb{} proteome includes homologs of the five core \ec{} divisome proteins FtsQ, FtsL, FtsB, FtsW, and FtsI \citep{wuCharacterizationConservedNovel2018}, suggesting that a similar approach can target protein-protein interactions in the \mtb{} divisome. However, it is unknown whether PerM directly interacts with FtsB  \citep{wangPersistentMycobacteriumTuberculosis2019} and, if it does, whether there is a regulatory mechanism for PerM beyond impacting FtsB stability. PerM lacks known orthologs outside of Actinomycetota \citep{goodsmithDisruptionTuberculosisMembrane2015}, so PerM interactions could potentially be targets of specific therapy. However, no experimental structural data have been published on the PerM-FtsB interaction or on PerM alone to guide experimental design. Expression and purification of Mtb PerM and FtsB for structural study is likely to pose difficulties given that FtsB stability depends upon PerM co-expression in Mtb and \msmegfull{} \citep{wangPersistentMycobacteriumTuberculosis2019}. Furthermore, proteins such as PerM with a high number of transmembrane helices pose challenges for recombinant expression \citep{graveHighthroughputStrategyIdentification2022, korepanovaCloningExpressionMultiple2005}.

Recent insights into the molecular structure and regulatory mechanisms of the gram-negative divisome have been enabled by the confluence of protein structure prediction, cryogenic electron microscopy (Cryo-EM), and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations. The extension from prediction of monomers to protein complexes \citep{baekAccuratePredictionProtein2021, evansProteinComplexPrediction2022} facilitated rapid structure prediction of the core \ec{} divisome \citep{attaibiUpdatedModelDivisome2022, cravenModelInteractionsFtsQLB2022}. Analysis of a Cryo-EM structure of the \pafull{} divisome was largely consistent with predicted protein-protein interfaces, but also revealed a global conformational change absent in structure predictions \citep{kashammerCryoEMStructureBacterial2023}. All-atom MD simulations identified this conformational change within 1 $\mu$s, and further predicted interactions between the core divisome and \ec{} FtsN \citep{brittonConformationalChangesEssential2023}. However, limitations of this MD approach, such as uncertainty in structure predictions and limited MD timescales, call for experimental validation. Importantly, in silico predictions for FtsN were corroborated by experimental results in living cells \citep{parkEssentialDomainFtsN2023}.

In this work, we employed a combination of structure prediction, MD, and fluorescence microscopy to probe the predicted interaction between \mtb{} PerM and FtsB proteins. In our approach, \mtb{} PerM and FtsB were expressed in \ec{} in order to directly attribute observations to changes in the \mtb{} proteins. First, we investigated conservation and dynamics at the predicted PerM-FtsB interface, identifying roles for conserved residues that are absent in structure predictions. Second, we showed that FtsB instability (when expressed in \ec{}) depends on a region predicted to bind FtsL and FtsQ, and that PerM expression in \ec{} can be enhanced by strategically modifying its N-terminal signal sequence. This enabled the quantification of the PerM-FtsB interaction via fluorescence correlation and single-molecule tracking. We found PerM expression in the \ec{} membrane to depend on the FtsB sequence predicted to mediate PerM-FtsB interaction. Lastly, we investigated MD simulations of \mtb{} divisome complexes suggestive of PerM regulatory complexity beyond FtsB stabilization.

\subsection{PerM stabilization in \ec{} membrane by FtsB depends on \ftsbH{}}

In order to confirm that FtsB increases membrane-localized PerM expression and, if so, to investigate the role of \ftsbH{} in this phenomenon, we co-expressed mNeonGreen- and mTurquoise2-labeled constructs and analyzed fluorescence in \ec{} microcolonies (Fig.~\ref{fig3}). In these experiments, expression of \permN{}-mNG was induced with \qty{100}{\uM} IPTG. Membrane-localization controls mNeonGreen (cytoplasmic) and Pf3-mNG (membrane) were induced with \qty{60}{\uM} and \qty{240}{\uM} IPTG, respectively, to match typical \permN{}-mNG expression levels. Expression of mTurquoise2-labeled FtsB constructs was induced with \qty{10}{\nM} ATc in all conditions except for one condition with no induction (indicated with down arrows in Fig.~\ref{fig3}). Brightfield images of \ec{} cells were segmented and protein concentration was estimated to be proportional to total integrated fluorescence after subtracting background and normalizing by cell size.

\end{figure*}

Relative to the reference condition (\permN{} and \ftsbdLQ{}, \qty{10}{\nM} ATc), there was an \qty{89}{\percent} ($p=\num{3.3e-12}$) decrease in mTq2-\ftsbdLQ{} expression in the absence of induction, with no significant differences observed for other conditions. The absence of any significant impact on wild-type FtsB expression ($p=0.97$) compared to when FtsB was expressed in the absence of PerM (compare Fig.~\ref{fig3}B to Fig.~\ref{fig2}A) suggests that \permN{} stabilizes FtsB when expressed in \ec{}, as was observed in \mtb{} \citep{wangPersistentMycobacteriumTuberculosis2019}. There was also no obvious difference in localization of any FtsB variant in any condition tested.

In contrast, there was a significant reduction in \permN{}-mNG expression of \qty{13.3}{\percent} ($p=\num{3.8e-2}$) in the absence of induction of mTq2-\ftsbdLQ{} expression, and a reduction of \qty{23.5}{\percent} ($p=\num{5.5e-4}$) when \ftsbdLQ{} was replaced with \ftsbdLQdH{}. There was no significant change when \ftsbdLQ{} was replaced with wild-type FtsB ($p=0.29$). This suggested that FtsB increases PerM stability in \ec{}, and that this depends on the presence of \ftsbH{}. However, inspection of Fig.~\ref{fig3}C suggests that our sample size is overpowered ($N=\num{10930}$ cells in total from 3 replicates; $607 \pm 44$ cells per condition per replicate) given variation between replicates in mNeonGreen expression levels. 

In preliminary experiments, we observed a large decrease in spatial correlation between mTurquoise2 and mNeonGreen fluorescence when \ftsbdLQ{} was depleted or replaced by \ftsbdLQdH{} (Fig.~\ref{fig3}D). The observation of small reductions in mNG-\permN{} levels despite apparently large impacts of different FtsB constructs on localization suggested that fluorescent mNeonGreen often remained in the cytoplasm following mNG-\permN{} degradation. We hypothesized that quantifying spatial correlation would be a more sensitive measurement less susceptible to variation in protein expression levels. Fig.~\ref{fig3}E shows scatter plots of mNeonGreen and mTurquoise2 intensities for pixels in typical cells with cytoplasmic mNeonGreen, membrane-localized Pf3-mNG, and \permN{}-mNG. We calculated Spearman correlation coefficients from such distributions for segmented cells and Fig.~\ref{fig3}F shows the mean and standard deviation of correlation coefficients for each condition and replicate.

In the reference condition (\permN{}-mNG, mTq2-\ftsbdLQ, \qty{10}{nM} ATc), correlation was high ($\rho = 0.87$, 0.84--0.89 \qty{95}{\percent} confidence interval) and indistinguishable from that when Pf3-mNG was expressed instead ($p = 0.72$). All other conditions had significant reductions in correlation. Wild-type FtsB was marginally less well correlated ($\rho = 0.80$, 0.77--0.83). The apparent reductions in \permN{}-mNG expression levels discussed above were more strongly supported by analysis of spatial correlation, with a drops in correlation in the absence of mTq2-\ftsbdLQ{} induction ($\rho = 0.71$, 0.69--0.73) and a larger drop when mTq2-\ftsbdLQ was replaced with mTq2-\ftsbdLQdH ($\rho = 0.52$, 0.46--0.58). While \ftsbLQ{} was not absolutely essential for membrane localization of \permN{}, this was also observed in the absence of any FtsB expression (Fig.~\ref{fig2}B).

\subsection{Single-molecule FtsB tracking}

Our correlation analysis strongly suggested that FtsB interaction with PerM via \ftsbH{} is key for expression of \permN{} in the membrane. Since we observed this for transgenic expression in \ec{}, it is unlikely that PerM-FtsB interaction is mediated by host proteins. However, transient PerM-FtsB interaction could be sufficient for PerM stability without a large fraction of molecules being bound at any time. If PerM is a significant component in the core \mtb{} divisome as suggested by depletion phenotypes and midcell localization \citep{goodsmithDisruptionTuberculosisMembrane2015, wangPersistentMycobacteriumTuberculosis2019}, we hypothesized that this implied long-lived FtsB-PerM interactions that could be detected by single-molecule tracking of FtsB diffusion. FtsB has a single transmembrane helix and PerM is predicted to have 8 (Fig.~\ref{fig1_1}A), suggesting an expected reduction in the FtsB diffusion coefficient from approximately 0.7 to \qty{0.3}{\square\um\per\s} upon PerM binding \citep{lucenaMicrodomainFormationGeneral2018}.
