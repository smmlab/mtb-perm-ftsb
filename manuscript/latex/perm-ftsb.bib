  abstract = {The synthesis of a peptidoglycan septum is a fundamental part of bacterial fission and is driven by a multiprotein dynamic complex called the divisome. FtsW and FtsI are essential proteins that synthesize the peptidoglycan septum and are controlled by the regulatory FtsBLQ subcomplex and the activator FtsN. However, their mode of regulation has not yet been uncovered in detail. Understanding this process in detail may enable the development of new compounds to combat the rise in antibiotic resistance. In this review, recent data on the regulation of septal peptidoglycan synthesis is summarized and discussed. Based on structural models and the collected data, multiple putative interactions within FtsWI and with regulators are uncovered. This elaborates on and supports an earlier proposed model that describes active and inactive conformations of the septal peptidoglycan synthesis complex that are stabilized by these interactions. Furthermore, a new model on the spatial organization of the newly synthesized peptidoglycan and the synthesis complex is presented. Overall, the updated model proposes a balance between several allosteric interactions that determine the state of septal peptidoglycan synthesis.},

Cell division has been studied extensively in the model rod-shaped bacteria Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, but much less is understood about cell division in mycobacteria, a genus that includes the major human pathogens M. tuberculosis and M. leprae. In general, bacterial cell division requires the concerted effort of many proteins in both space and time to elongate the cell, replicate and segregate the chromosome, and construct and destruct the septum - processes which result in the creation of two new daughter cells. Here, we describe these distinct stages of cell division in B. subtilis and follow with the current knowledge in mycobacteria. As will become apparent, there are many differences between mycobacteria and B. subtilis in terms of both the broad outline of cell division and the molecular details. So, while the fundamental challenge of spatially and temporally organizing cell division is shared between these rod-shaped bacteria, they have solved these challenges in often vastly different ways.},

Here, we present a model of the structure and dynamics of the core complex of the E. coli divisome, supported by a combination of structure prediction, molecular dynamics simulation, single-molecule imaging, and mutagenesis. We focus on the septal cell wall synthase complex formed by FtsW and FtsI, and its regulators FtsQ, FtsL, FtsB, and FtsN. The results indicate extensive interactions in four regions in the periplasmic domains of the complex. FtsQ, FtsL, and FtsB support FtsI in an extended conformation, with the FtsI transpeptidase domain lifted away from the membrane through interactions among the C-terminal domains. FtsN binds between FtsI and FtsL in a region rich in residues with superfission (activating) and dominant negative (inhibitory) mutations. Mutagenesis experiments and simulations suggest that the essential domain of FtsN links FtsI and FtsL together, potentially modulating interactions between the anchor-loop of FtsI and the putative catalytic cavity of FtsW, thus suggesting a mechanism of how FtsN activates the cell wall synthesis activities of FtsW and FtsI.},

Despite its importance, however, our understanding of this complex cell envelope is rudimentary at best. Thus, molecular modeling and simulation of such an envelope can benefit the scientific community by proposing new hypotheses about the biophysical properties of its different layers. In this Perspective, we present recent advances in molecular modeling and simulation of the mycobacterial cell envelope from individual components to cell envelope assemblies. We also show how modeling other types of cell envelopes, such as that of Escherichia coli, may help modeling part of the mycobacterial envelopes. We hope that the studies presented here are just the beginning of the road and more and more new modeling and simulation studies help us to understand crucial questions related to mycobacteria such as antibiotic resistance or bacterial survival in the host.},

Here, we apply AlphaFold2 for the prediction of heterodimeric protein complexes. We find that the AlphaFold2 protocol together with optimised multiple sequence alignments, generate models with acceptable quality (DockQ\,{$\geq$}\,0.23) for 63\% of the dimers. From the predicted interfaces we create a simple function to predict the DockQ score which distinguishes acceptable from incorrect models as well as interacting from non-interacting proteins with state-of-art accuracy. We find that, using the predicted DockQ scores, we can identify 51\% of all interacting pairs at 1\% FPR.},

  abstract = {In late 2020, after circulating for almost a year in the human population, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exhibited a major step change in its adaptation to humans. These highly mutated forms of SARS-CoV-2 had enhanced rates of transmission relative to previous variants and were termed `variants of concern' (VOCs). Designated Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron, the VOCs emerged independently from one another, and in turn each rapidly became dominant, regionally or globally, outcompeting previous variants. The success of each VOC relative to the previously dominant variant was enabled by altered intrinsic functional properties of the virus and, to various degrees, changes to virus antigenicity conferring the ability to evade a primed immune response. The increased virus fitness associated with VOCs is the result of a complex interplay of virus biology in the context of changing human immunity due to both vaccination and prior infection. In this Review, we summarize the literature on the relative transmissibility and antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variants, the role of mutations at the furin spike cleavage site and of non-spike proteins, the potential importance of recombination to virus success, and SARS-CoV-2 evolution in the context of T cells, innate immunity and population immunity. SARS-CoV-2 shows a complicated relationship among virus antigenicity, transmission and virulence, which has unpredictable implications for the future trajectory and disease burden of COVID-19.},

  abstract = {In Escherichia coli, an important step in the divisome assembly pathway is the recruitment of the essential cell wall synthase complex FtsWI to the division site through interactions with the regulatory FtsQLB complex. Here, we investigate a key aspect of this recruitment by characterizing the structural organization of the FtsL-FtsW interaction. Mutations in the cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions of the two proteins result in cell division defects and loss of FtsW localization to division sites. We use these in vivo results to help validate the predicted interfaces from an AlphaFold2 model for the entire FtsQLBWI complex. Given the consistency between the predicted FtsQLBWI model and our current understanding of the structure and function of the complex, we further remodeled it, seeking insight into the potential structural transitions that may lead to activation of the FtsWI complex and PG synthesis. The model suggests that FtsLB serves as a support for FtsI, placing its periplasmic domain in an extended and possibly active conformation but it is also compatible with a proposed compact and possibly inactive conformation. Additionally, we reconfigure the model into an Fts[QLBWI]2 diprotomeric state, which suggests that FtsLB may act as a central hub during assembly of the PG synthesis machinery. Finally, we propose a possible role for FtsQ in activation of this machinery, potentially by acting as a gatekeeper for the interaction between the FtsL AWI region and FtsI. We propose that this gatekeeping function depends on a hinge next to the FtsLB CCD region, which has implications for the mechanisms behind the FtsLB off/on transition that is central to cell division regulation.},

Unique network outputs such as the gradient of the distance field allow Omnipose to accurately segment cells on which current algorithms, including its predecessor, Cellpose, produce errors. We show that Omnipose achieves unprecedented segmentation performance on mixed bacterial cultures, antibiotic-treated cells and cells of elongated or branched morphology. Furthermore, the benefits of Omnipose extend to non-bacterial subjects, varied imaging modalities and three-dimensional objects. Finally, we demonstrate the utility of Omnipose in the characterization of extreme morphological phenotypes that arise during interbacterial antagonism.

In this work, we demonstrate that an AlphaFold model trained specifically for multimeric inputs of known stoichiometry, which we call AlphaFold-Multimer, significantly increases accuracy of predicted multimeric interfaces over input-adapted single-chain AlphaFold while maintaining high intra-chain accuracy. On a benchmark dataset of 17 heterodimer proteins without templates (introduced in [2]) we achieve at least medium accuracy (DockQ [3] {$\geq$} 0.49) on 13 targets and high accuracy (DockQ {$\geq$} 0.8) on 7 targets, compared to 9 targets of at least medium accuracy and 4 of high accuracy for the previous state of the art system (an AlphaFold-based system from [2]). We also predict structures for a large dataset of 4,446 recent protein complexes, from which we score all non-redundant interfaces with low template identity. For heteromeric interfaces we successfully predict the interface (DockQ {$\geq$} 0.23) in 70\% of cases, and produce high accuracy predictions (DockQ {$\geq$} 0.8) in 26\% of cases, an improvement of +27 and +14 percentage points over the flexible linker modification of AlphaFold [4] respectively.

To examine the robustness of HMR and the influence of protonation states of phosphate groups on LPS bilayer properties, eight different LPS-type all-atom systems with two phosphate protonation states are modeled and simulated utilizing both OpenMM 2-fs (standard) and 4-fs (HMR) schemes. Consistency in the conformational space sampled by standard and HMR simulations shows the reliability of HMR even in LPS, one of the most complex biomolecules. For systems with different protonation states, similar conformations are sampled with a PO41-- or PO42-- group, but different phosphate protonation states make slight impacts on lipid packing and conformational properties of LPS acyl chains. Systems with PO41-- have a slightly smaller area per lipid and thus slightly more ordered lipid A acyl chains compared to those with PO42--, due to more electrostatic repulsion between PO42-- even with neutralizing Ca2+ ions. HMR and different protonation states of phosphates of LPS available in CHARMM-GUI are expected to be useful for further investigations of biological systems of diverse origin.},

The popular, but modestly bright, Enhanced Cyan Fluorescent Protein (ECFP) was sequentially improved into the brighter variants Super Cyan Fluorescent Protein 3A (SCFP3A) and mTurquoise, the latter exhibiting a high-fluorescence quantum yield and a long mono-exponential fluorescence lifetime. Here we combine X-ray crystallography and excited-state calculations to rationalize these stepwise improvements. The enhancement originates from stabilization of the seventh beta-strand and the strengthening of the sole chromophore-stabilizing hydrogen bond. The structural analysis highlighted one suboptimal internal residue, which was subjected to saturation mutagenesis combined with fluorescence lifetime-based screening. This resulted in mTurquoise2, a brighter variant with faster maturation, high photostability, longer mono-exponential lifetime and the highest quantum yield measured for a monomeric fluorescent protein. Together, these properties make mTurquoise2 the preferable cyan variant of green fluorescent protein for long-term imaging and as donor for Forster resonance energy transfer to a yellow fluorescent protein.},

This method allows protein expression condition screening for multiple protein targets simultaneously by monitoring frGFP fluorescence in growing cells. We discuss the impact of common protein expression conditions on 42 essential M. tuberculosis H37Rv helical transmembrane proteins and establish the grounds for their further analysis. We have found that the basal expression of the lac operon in the T7-promoter expression system generally leads to high recombinant protein yield in M. smegmatis, and we suggest that a screening condition without the inducer is included in routine protein expression tests. In addition to the general observations, we describe conditions allowing high-level expression of more than 25 essential M. tuberculosis membrane proteins, containing 2 to 13 transmembrane helices. We hope that these findings will stimulate M. tuberculosis membrane protein research and aid the efforts in drug development against tuberculosis.},

However, accurately inferring information from SPT studies is challenging due to biases in both data analysis and experimental design. To address analysis bias, we introduce `Spot-On', an intuitive web-interface. Spot-On implements a kinetic modeling framework that accounts for known biases, including molecules moving out-of-focus, and robustly infers diffusion constants and subpopulations from pooled single-molecule trajectories. To minimize inherent experimental biases, we implement and validate stroboscopic photo-activation SPT (spaSPT), which minimizes motion-blur bias and tracking errors. We validate Spot-On using experimentally realistic simulations and show that Spot-On outperforms other methods. We then apply Spot-On to spaSPT data from live mammalian cells spanning a wide range of nuclear dynamics and demonstrate that Spot-On consistently and robustly infers subpopulation fractions and diffusion constants.},

Interpretation of SPT with fast-diffusing proteins in mammalian cells, however, is complicated by technical limitations imposed by fast image acquisition. These limitations include short trajectory length due to photobleaching and shallow depth of field, high localization error due to the low photon budget imposed by short integration times, and cell-to-cell variability. To address these issues, we investigated methods inspired by Bayesian nonparametrics to infer distributions of state parameters from SPT data with short trajectories, variable localization precision, and absence of prior knowledge about the number of underlying states. We discuss the advantages and disadvantages of these approaches relative to other frameworks for SPT analysis.},

Despite advances in understanding the molecular biology of microbial gene regulation, many experiments employ protein-expression systems exhibiting high noise and nearly all-or-none responses to induction. I present an expression system that incorporates elements known to reduce gene expression noise: negative autoregulation and bicistronic transcription. I show by stochastic simulation that while negative autoregulation can produce a more gradual response to induction, bicistronic expression of a repressor and gene of interest can be necessary to reduce noise below the extrinsic limit. I synthesized a plasmid-based system incorporating these principles and studied its properties in Escherichia coli cells, using flow cytometry and fluorescence microscopy to characterize induction dose-response, induction/repression kinetics and gene expression noise. By varying ribosome binding site strengths, expression levels from 55--10,740 molecules/cell were achieved with noise below the extrinsic limit. Individual strains are inducible across a dynamic range greater than 20-fold. Experimental comparison of different regulatory networks confirmed that bicistronic autoregulation reduces noise, and revealed unexpectedly high noise for a conventional expression system with a constitutively expressed transcriptional repressor. I suggest a hybrid, low-noise expression system to increase the dynamic range.},

  abstract = {Background The existing estimate of the global burden of latent TB infection (LTBI) as ``one-third'' of the world population is nearly 20 y old. Given the importance of controlling LTBI as part of the End TB Strategy for eliminating TB by 2050, changes in demography and scientific understanding, and progress in TB control, it is important to re-assess the global burden of LTBI. Methods and Findings We constructed trends in annual risk in infection (ARI) for countries between 1934 and 2014 using a combination of direct estimates of ARI from LTBI surveys (131 surveys from 1950 to 2011) and indirect estimates of ARI calculated from World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates of smear positive TB prevalence from 1990 to 2014. Gaussian process regression was used to generate ARIs for country-years without data and to represent uncertainty. Estimated ARI time-series were applied to the demography in each country to calculate the number and proportions of individuals infected, recently infected (infected within 2 y), and recently infected with isoniazid (INH)-resistant strains. Resulting estimates were aggregated by WHO region. We estimated the contribution of existing infections to TB incidence in 2035 and 2050. In 2014, the global burden of LTBI was 23.0\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI]: 20.4\%--26.4\%), amounting to approximately 1.7 billion people. WHO South-East Asia, Western-Pacific, and Africa regions had the highest prevalence and accounted for around 80\% of those with LTBI. Prevalence of recent infection was 0.8\% (95\% UI: 0.7\%--0.9\%) of the global population, amounting to 55.5 (95\% UI: 48.2--63.8) million individuals currently at high risk of TB disease, of which 10.9\% (95\% UI:10.2\%--11.8\%) was isoniazid-resistant. Current LTBI alone, assuming no additional infections from 2015 onwards, would be expected to generate TB incidences in the region of 16.5 per 100,000 per year in 2035 and 8.3 per 100,000 per year in 2050. Limitations included the quantity and methodological heterogeneity of direct ARI data, and limited evidence to inform on potential clearance of LTBI. Conclusions We estimate that approximately 1.7 billion individuals were latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) globally in 2014, just under a quarter of the global population. Investment in new tools to improve diagnosis and treatment of those with LTBI at risk of progressing to disease is urgently needed to address this latent reservoir if the 2050 target of eliminating TB is to be reached.},

Here, we delineated the role of ftsQ, a terminal gene of the highly conserved division cell wall (dcw) operon, in growth, survival, and cell length maintenance in the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We found that FtsQ overexpression significantly increases the cell length and number of multiseptate cells. FtsQ depletion in Mtb resulted in cells that were shorter than WT cells during the initial growth stages (4 days after FtsQ depletion) but were longer than WT cells at later stages (10 days after FtsQ depletion) and compromised the survival in vitro and in differentiated THP1 macrophages. Overexpression of N- and C-terminal FtsQ regions altered the cell length, and the C-terminal domain alone complemented the FtsQ depletion phenotype. MS analyses suggested robust FtsQ phosphorylation on Thr-24, and although phosphoablative and -mimetic mutants rescued the FtsQ depletion--associated cell viability defects, they failed to complement the cell length defects. MS and coimmunoprecipitation experiments identified 63 FtsQ-interacting partners, and we show that the interaction of FtsQ with the recently identified cell division protein SepIVA is independent of FtsQ phosphorylation and suggests a role of FtsQ in modulating cell division. FtsQ exhibited predominantly septal localization in both the presence and absence of SepIVA. Our results suggest a role for FtsQ in modulating the length, division, and survival of Mtb cells both in vitro and in the host.},

With the ability to provide atomistic detail, computational methods are well poised to study these processes. Here, accelerated molecular dynamics (aMD) is proposed to simulate processes of ligand binding to a G-protein-coupled receptor (GPCR), in this case the M3 muscarinic receptor, which is a target for treating many human diseases, including cancer, diabetes and obesity. Long-timescale aMD simulations were performed to observe the binding of three chemically diverse ligand molecules: antagonist tiotropium (TTP), partial agonist arecoline (ARc) and full agonist acetylcholine (ACh). In comparison with earlier microsecond-timescale conventional MD simulations, aMD greatly accelerated the binding of ACh to the receptor orthosteric ligand-binding site and the binding of TTP to an extracellular vestibule. Further aMD simulations also captured binding of ARc to the receptor orthosteric site. Additionally, all three ligands were observed to bind in the extracellular vestibule during their binding pathways, suggesting that it is a metastable binding site. This study demonstrates the applicability of aMD to protein--ligand binding, especially the drug recognition of GPCRs.},

Thus, at the core of the divisome are the transglycosylase FtsW, which synthesises peptidoglycan strands from its substrate Lipid II, and the transpeptidase FtsI that cross-links these strands to form a mesh, shaping and protecting the bacterial cell. The FtsQ--FtsB--FtsL trimeric complex interacts with the FtsWI complex and is involved in regulating its enzymatic activities; however, the structure of this pentameric complex is unknown. Here, we present the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the FtsWIQBL complex from Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.7\,{\AA} resolution. Our work reveals intricate structural details, including an extended coiled coil formed by FtsL and FtsB and the periplasmic interaction site between FtsL and FtsI. Our structure explains the consequences of previously reported mutations and we postulate a possible activation mechanism involving a large conformational change in the periplasmic domain. As FtsWIQBL is central to the divisome, our structure is foundational for the design of future experiments elucidating the precise mechanism of bacterial cell division, an important antibiotic target.},

A combination of T7 promoter-based vectors with hexa-His affinity tags and BL21 E. coli strains with additional tRNA genes to supplement sparsely used E. coli codons have been most successful. The expressed proteins have a wide range of molecular weights and number of transmembrane helices. Expression of these proteins has been observed in the membrane and insoluble fraction of E. coli cell lysates and, in some cases, in the soluble fraction. The highest expression levels in the membrane fraction were restricted to a narrow range of molecular weights and relatively few transmembrane helices. In contrast, overexpression in insoluble aggregates was distributed over a broad range of molecular weights and number of transmembrane helices.},

We presented a case of a household contact of rifampicin-resistant TB revealing reactive IFN-gamma release assay with unsuspicious clinical and radiologic examinations. She was diagnosed with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and treated with isoniazid monotherapy. On the ninth month, she developed a progressive cough and was found to harbor active TB disease with added resistance to isoniazid. An individualized anti-TB regimen consisting of moxifloxacin, kanamycin, prothionamide, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide was prescribed for 20 months, leading to sputum culture conversion and improvement of the reported symptom. No recurrence was observed on one-year follow-up. Assuming high compliance to therapy, we propose that the patient may have been underdiagnosed and received sub-optimal treatment leading to acquired-drug resistance. Conventional diagnosis methods based on immunological assay and radiographical findings may be insufficient to distinguish the incipient and subclinical states of TB from LTBI.},

The advent of recombinant inbred mouse panels and next-generation transposon mutagenesis and sequencing approaches has enabled dissection of complex host--pathogen interactions. To identify host and pathogen genetic determinants of Mtb pathogenesis, we infected members of the highly diverse BXD family of strains with a comprehensive library of Mtb transposon mutants (TnSeq). Members of the BXD family segregate for Mtb-resistant C57BL/6J (B6 or B) and Mtb-susceptible DBA/2J (D2 or D) haplotypes. The survival of each bacterial mutant was quantified within each BXD host, and we identified those bacterial genes that were differentially required for Mtb fitness across BXD genotypes. Mutants that varied in survival among the host family of strains were leveraged as reporters of ``endophenotypes,'' each bacterial fitness profile directly probing specific components of the infection microenvironment. We conducted quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of these bacterial fitness endophenotypes and identified 140 host--pathogen QTL (hpQTL). We located a QTL hotspot on chromosome 6 (75.97--88.58 Mb) associated with the genetic requirement of multiple Mtb genes: Rv0127 (mak), Rv0359 (rip2), Rv0955 (perM), and Rv3849 (espR). Together, this screen reinforces the utility of bacterial mutant libraries as precise reporters of the host immunological microenvironment during infection and highlights specific host--pathogen genetic interactions for further investigation. To enable downstream follow-up for both bacterial and mammalian genetic research communities, all bacterial fitness profiles have been deposited into GeneNetwork.org and added into the comprehensive collection of TnSeq libraries in MtbTnDB.},

In E. coli FtsN activates FtsWI and a previous model posited that the essential domain of FtsN (EFtsN) acts on FtsQLB causing conformational changes so that a domain of FtsL, called AWI (AWIFtsL), contacts FtsI resulting in activation of FtsW. In this study we use genetic analysis along with an AlphaFold2 model to test this activation model. Based on our findings we propose an updated model wherein the AWIFtsL and FtsI interaction is stabilized by EFtsN to activate FtsW and that this interaction is enhanced by the CytoFtsN-FtsA interaction. Thus, FtsN acts as both a sensor for divisome assembly and an activator. In addition, we elucidate the role played by two critical FtsL residues in FtsW activation.},

  abstract = {The use of antibiotics is threatened by the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria. Thus, there is a need to develop antibiotics that address new targets. In this respect, the bacterial divisome, a multi-protein complex central to cell division, represents a potentially attractive target. Of particular interest is the FtsQB subcomplex that plays a decisive role in divisome assembly and peptidoglycan biogenesis in E. coli. Here, we report the structure-based design of a macrocyclic covalent inhibitor derived from a periplasmic region of FtsB that mediates its binding to FtsQ. The bioactive conformation of this motif was stabilized by a customized cross-link resulting in a tertiary structure mimetic with increased affinity for FtsQ. To increase activity, a covalent handle was incorporated, providing an inhibitor that impedes the interaction between FtsQ and FtsB irreversibly. The covalent inhibitor reduced the growth of an outer membrane-permeable E. coli strain, concurrent with the expected loss of FtsB localization, and also affected the infection of zebrafish larvae by a clinical E. coli strain. This first-in-class inhibitor of a divisome protein--protein interaction highlights the potential of proteomimetic molecules as inhibitors of challenging targets. In particular, the covalent mode-of-action can serve as an inspiration for future antibiotics that target protein--protein interactions.},

  abstract = {Microorganisms are often studied as populations but the behaviour of single, individual cells can have important consequences. For example, tuberculosis, caused by the bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, requires months of antibiotic therapy even though the bulk of the bacterial population dies rapidly. Shorter courses lead to high rates of relapse because subpopulations of bacilli can survive despite being genetically identical to those that are easily killed. In fact, mycobacteria create variability each time a cell divides, producing daughter cells with different sizes and growth rates. The mechanism(s) that underlie this high-frequency variation and how variability relates to survival of the population are unknown. Here we show that mycobacteria actively create heterogeneity. Using a fluorescent reporter and a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based transposon screen, we find that deletion of lamA, a gene of previously unknown function, decreases heterogeneity in the population by decreasing asymmetric polar growth. LamA has no known homologues in other organisms, but is highly conserved across mycobacterial species. We find that LamA is a member of the mycobacterial division complex (the 'divisome'). It inhibits growth at nascent new poles, creating asymmetry in polar growth. The kinetics of killing individual cells that lack lamA are more uniform and more rapid with rifampicin and drugs that target the cell wall. Our results show that mycobacteria encode a non-conserved protein that controls the pattern of cell growth, resulting in a population that is both heterogeneous and better able to survive antibiotic pressure.},

In this paper, we describe a new program called Clustal Omega, which can align virtually any number of protein sequences quickly and that delivers accurate alignments. The accuracy of the package on smaller test cases is similar to that of the high-quality aligners. On larger data sets, Clustal Omega outperforms other packages in terms of execution time and quality. Clustal Omega also has powerful features for adding sequences to and exploiting information in existing alignments, making use of the vast amount of precomputed information in public databases like Pfam.},

We report new plasmids that use the same principles to achieve simultaneous, low-noise expression for two genes in Escherichia coli. The TetR system was moved to a compatible plasmid backbone, and a system based on the lac repressor (LacI) was found to also exhibit gene expression noise below the extrinsic noise limit. We characterized gene expression mean and noise across the range of induction levels for these plasmids, applied the LacI system to tune expression for single-molecule mRNA detection under two different growth conditions, and showed that two plasmids can be cotransformed to independently tune expression of two different genes. IMPORTANCE Microbiologists often express foreign proteins in bacteria in order study them or to use bacteria as a microbial factory. Usually, this requires controlling the number of foreign proteins expressed in each cell, but for many common protein expression systems, it is difficult to ``tune'' protein expression without large cell-to-cell variation in expression levels (called ``noise'' in protein expression). This work describes two protein expression systems that can be combined in the same cell, with tunable expression levels and very low protein expression noise. One new system was used to detect single mRNA molecules by fluorescence microscopy, and the two systems were shown to be independent of each other. These protein expression systems may be useful in any experiment or biotechnology application that can be improved with low protein expression noise.},

We present CHARMM-GUI Enhanced Sampler, a web-based tool to prepare various enhanced sampling simulations inputs with user-selected collective variables (CVs). Enhanced Sampler provides inputs for the following nine methods: accelerated MD, Gaussian accelerated MD, conformational flooding, metadynamics, adaptive biasing force, steered MD, temperature replica exchange MD, replica exchange solute tempering 2, and replica exchange umbrella sampling for the method-implemented MD packages including AMBER, CHARMM, GENESIS, GROMACS, NAMD, and OpenMM. Users only need to select a group of atoms via intuitive web-implementation in order to define commonly used nine CVs of interest: center of mass based distance, angle, dihedral, root-mean-square-distance, radius of gyration, distance projected on axis, two types of angles projected on axis, and coordination numbers. The enhanced sampling methods are tested with several biological systems to illustrate their efficiency over conventional MD. Enhanced Sampler with carefully optimized system-dependent parameters will help users to get meaningful results from their enhanced sampling simulations.},

It offers a versatile and modular solution that works out of the box for end users, through a simple and intuitive user interface. It is also easily scriptable and adaptable, operating equally well on 1D over time, 2D over time, 3D over time, or other single and multi-channel image variants. TrackMate provides several visualization and analysis tools that aid in assessing the relevance of results. The utility of TrackMate is further enhanced through its ability to be readily customized to meet specific tracking problems. TrackMate is an extensible platform where developers can easily write their own detection, particle linking, visualization or analysis algorithms within the TrackMate environment. This evolving framework provides researchers with the opportunity to quickly develop and optimize new algorithms based on existing TrackMate modules without the need of having to write de novo user interfaces, including visualization, analysis and exporting tools. The current capabilities of TrackMate are presented in the context of three different biological problems. First, we perform Caenorhabditis-elegans lineage analysis to assess how light-induced damage during imaging impairs its early development. Our TrackMate-based lineage analysis indicates the lack of a cell-specific light-sensitive mechanism. Second, we investigate the recruitment of NEMO (NF-{$\kappa$}B essential modulator) clusters in fibroblasts after stimulation by the cytokine IL-1 and show that photodamage can generate artifacts in the shape of TrackMate characterized movements that confuse motility analysis. Finally, we validate the use of TrackMate for quantitative lifetime analysis of clathrin-mediated endocytosis in plant cells.},

Here, we show that perM deletion caused a cell division defect specifically during the chronic phase of mouse infection, but did not affect Mtb's cell replication during acute infection. We further demonstrate that PerM is required for cell division in chronically infected mice and in vitro under host-relevant stresses because it is part of the mycobacterial divisome and stabilizes the essential divisome protein FtsB. These data highlight the importance of sustained cell division for Mtb persistence, define condition-specific requirements for cell division and reveal that survival of Mtb during chronic infection depends on a persistence divisome.},

  abstract = {Septation in bacteria requires coordinated regulation of cell wall biosynthesis and hydrolysis enzymes so that new septal cross-wall can be appropriately constructed without compromising the integrity of the existing cell wall. Bacteria with different modes of growth and different types of cell wall require different regulators to mediate cell growth and division processes. Mycobacteria have both a cell wall structure and a mode of growth that are distinct from well-studied model organisms and use several different regulatory mechanisms. Here, using Mycobacterium smegmatis, we identify and characterize homologs of the conserved cell division regulators FtsL and FtsB, and show that they appear to function similarly to their homologs in Escherichia coli. We identify a number of previously undescribed septally localized factors which could be involved in cell wall regulation. One of these, SepIVA, has a DivIVA domain, is required for mycobacterial septation, and is localized to the septum and the intracellular membrane domain. We propose that SepIVA is a regulator of cell wall precursor enzymes that contribute to construction of the septal cross-wall, similar to the putative elongation function of the other mycobacterial DivIVA homolog, Wag31., IMPORTANCE The enzymes that build bacterial cell walls are essential for cell survival but can cause cell lysis if misregulated; thus, their regulators are also essential. The number and nature of these regulators is likely to vary in bacteria that grow in different ways. The mycobacteria are a genus that have a cell wall whose composition and construction vary greatly from those of well-studied model organisms. In this work, we identify and characterize some of the proteins that regulate the mycobacterial cell wall. We find that some of these regulators appear to be functionally conserved with their structural homologs in evolutionarily distant species such as Escherichia coli, but other proteins have critical regulatory functions that may be unique to the actinomycetes.},
