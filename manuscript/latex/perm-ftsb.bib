  abstract = {The synthesis of a peptidoglycan septum is a fundamental part of bacterial fission and is driven by a multiprotein dynamic complex called the divisome. FtsW and FtsI are essential proteins that synthesize the peptidoglycan septum and are controlled by the regulatory FtsBLQ subcomplex and the activator FtsN. However, their mode of regulation has not yet been uncovered in detail. Understanding this process in detail may enable the development of new compounds to combat the rise in antibiotic resistance. In this review, recent data on the regulation of septal peptidoglycan synthesis is summarized and discussed. Based on structural models and the collected data, multiple putative interactions within FtsWI and with regulators are uncovered. This elaborates on and supports an earlier proposed model that describes active and inactive conformations of the septal peptidoglycan synthesis complex that are stabilized by these interactions. Furthermore, a new model on the spatial organization of the newly synthesized peptidoglycan and the synthesis complex is presented. Overall, the updated model proposes a balance between several allosteric interactions that determine the state of septal peptidoglycan synthesis.},

Cell division has been studied extensively in the model rod-shaped bacteria Escherichia coli and Bacillus subtilis, but much less is understood about cell division in mycobacteria, a genus that includes the major human pathogens M. tuberculosis and M. leprae. In general, bacterial cell division requires the concerted effort of many proteins in both space and time to elongate the cell, replicate and segregate the chromosome, and construct and destruct the septum - processes which result in the creation of two new daughter cells. Here, we describe these distinct stages of cell division in B. subtilis and follow with the current knowledge in mycobacteria. As will become apparent, there are many differences between mycobacteria and B. subtilis in terms of both the broad outline of cell division and the molecular details. So, while the fundamental challenge of spatially and temporally organizing cell division is shared between these rod-shaped bacteria, they have solved these challenges in often vastly different ways.},

Here, we present a model of the structure and dynamics of the core complex of the E. coli divisome, supported by a combination of structure prediction, molecular dynamics simulation, single-molecule imaging, and mutagenesis. We focus on the septal cell wall synthase complex formed by FtsW and FtsI, and its regulators FtsQ, FtsL, FtsB, and FtsN. The results indicate extensive interactions in four regions in the periplasmic domains of the complex. FtsQ, FtsL, and FtsB support FtsI in an extended conformation, with the FtsI transpeptidase domain lifted away from the membrane through interactions among the C-terminal domains. FtsN binds between FtsI and FtsL in a region rich in residues with superfission (activating) and dominant negative (inhibitory) mutations. Mutagenesis experiments and simulations suggest that the essential domain of FtsN links FtsI and FtsL together, potentially modulating interactions between the anchor-loop of FtsI and the putative catalytic cavity of FtsW, thus suggesting a mechanism of how FtsN activates the cell wall synthesis activities of FtsW and FtsI.},

  abstract = {In late 2020, after circulating for almost a year in the human population, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) exhibited a major step change in its adaptation to humans. These highly mutated forms of SARS-CoV-2 had enhanced rates of transmission relative to previous variants and were termed `variants of concern' (VOCs). Designated Alpha, Beta, Gamma, Delta and Omicron, the VOCs emerged independently from one another, and in turn each rapidly became dominant, regionally or globally, outcompeting previous variants. The success of each VOC relative to the previously dominant variant was enabled by altered intrinsic functional properties of the virus and, to various degrees, changes to virus antigenicity conferring the ability to evade a primed immune response. The increased virus fitness associated with VOCs is the result of a complex interplay of virus biology in the context of changing human immunity due to both vaccination and prior infection. In this Review, we summarize the literature on the relative transmissibility and antigenicity of SARS-CoV-2 variants, the role of mutations at the furin spike cleavage site and of non-spike proteins, the potential importance of recombination to virus success, and SARS-CoV-2 evolution in the context of T cells, innate immunity and population immunity. SARS-CoV-2 shows a complicated relationship among virus antigenicity, transmission and virulence, which has unpredictable implications for the future trajectory and disease burden of COVID-19.},

  abstract = {In Escherichia coli, an important step in the divisome assembly pathway is the recruitment of the essential cell wall synthase complex FtsWI to the division site through interactions with the regulatory FtsQLB complex. Here, we investigate a key aspect of this recruitment by characterizing the structural organization of the FtsL-FtsW interaction. Mutations in the cytoplasmic and transmembrane regions of the two proteins result in cell division defects and loss of FtsW localization to division sites. We use these in vivo results to help validate the predicted interfaces from an AlphaFold2 model for the entire FtsQLBWI complex. Given the consistency between the predicted FtsQLBWI model and our current understanding of the structure and function of the complex, we further remodeled it, seeking insight into the potential structural transitions that may lead to activation of the FtsWI complex and PG synthesis. The model suggests that FtsLB serves as a support for FtsI, placing its periplasmic domain in an extended and possibly active conformation but it is also compatible with a proposed compact and possibly inactive conformation. Additionally, we reconfigure the model into an Fts[QLBWI]2 diprotomeric state, which suggests that FtsLB may act as a central hub during assembly of the PG synthesis machinery. Finally, we propose a possible role for FtsQ in activation of this machinery, potentially by acting as a gatekeeper for the interaction between the FtsL AWI region and FtsI. We propose that this gatekeeping function depends on a hinge next to the FtsLB CCD region, which has implications for the mechanisms behind the FtsLB off/on transition that is central to cell division regulation.},

In this work, we demonstrate that an AlphaFold model trained specifically for multimeric inputs of known stoichiometry, which we call AlphaFold-Multimer, significantly increases accuracy of predicted multimeric interfaces over input-adapted single-chain AlphaFold while maintaining high intra-chain accuracy. On a benchmark dataset of 17 heterodimer proteins without templates (introduced in [2]) we achieve at least medium accuracy (DockQ [3] {$\geq$} 0.49) on 13 targets and high accuracy (DockQ {$\geq$} 0.8) on 7 targets, compared to 9 targets of at least medium accuracy and 4 of high accuracy for the previous state of the art system (an AlphaFold-based system from [2]). We also predict structures for a large dataset of 4,446 recent protein complexes, from which we score all non-redundant interfaces with low template identity. For heteromeric interfaces we successfully predict the interface (DockQ {$\geq$} 0.23) in 70\% of cases, and produce high accuracy predictions (DockQ {$\geq$} 0.8) in 26\% of cases, an improvement of +27 and +14 percentage points over the flexible linker modification of AlphaFold [4] respectively.

  abstract = {Background The existing estimate of the global burden of latent TB infection (LTBI) as ``one-third'' of the world population is nearly 20 y old. Given the importance of controlling LTBI as part of the End TB Strategy for eliminating TB by 2050, changes in demography and scientific understanding, and progress in TB control, it is important to re-assess the global burden of LTBI. Methods and Findings We constructed trends in annual risk in infection (ARI) for countries between 1934 and 2014 using a combination of direct estimates of ARI from LTBI surveys (131 surveys from 1950 to 2011) and indirect estimates of ARI calculated from World Health Organisation (WHO) estimates of smear positive TB prevalence from 1990 to 2014. Gaussian process regression was used to generate ARIs for country-years without data and to represent uncertainty. Estimated ARI time-series were applied to the demography in each country to calculate the number and proportions of individuals infected, recently infected (infected within 2 y), and recently infected with isoniazid (INH)-resistant strains. Resulting estimates were aggregated by WHO region. We estimated the contribution of existing infections to TB incidence in 2035 and 2050. In 2014, the global burden of LTBI was 23.0\% (95\% uncertainty interval [UI]: 20.4\%--26.4\%), amounting to approximately 1.7 billion people. WHO South-East Asia, Western-Pacific, and Africa regions had the highest prevalence and accounted for around 80\% of those with LTBI. Prevalence of recent infection was 0.8\% (95\% UI: 0.7\%--0.9\%) of the global population, amounting to 55.5 (95\% UI: 48.2--63.8) million individuals currently at high risk of TB disease, of which 10.9\% (95\% UI:10.2\%--11.8\%) was isoniazid-resistant. Current LTBI alone, assuming no additional infections from 2015 onwards, would be expected to generate TB incidences in the region of 16.5 per 100,000 per year in 2035 and 8.3 per 100,000 per year in 2050. Limitations included the quantity and methodological heterogeneity of direct ARI data, and limited evidence to inform on potential clearance of LTBI. Conclusions We estimate that approximately 1.7 billion individuals were latently infected with Mycobacterium tuberculosis (M.tb) globally in 2014, just under a quarter of the global population. Investment in new tools to improve diagnosis and treatment of those with LTBI at risk of progressing to disease is urgently needed to address this latent reservoir if the 2050 target of eliminating TB is to be reached.},

  abstract = {Identifying and characterizing the individual contributors to bacterial cellular elongation and division will improve our understanding of their impact on cell growth and division. Here, we delineated the role of ftsQ, a terminal gene of the highly conserved division cell wall (dcw) operon, in growth, survival, and cell length maintenance in the human pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb). We found that FtsQ overexpression significantly increases the cell length and number of multiseptate cells. FtsQ depletion in Mtb resulted in cells that were shorter than WT cells during the initial growth stages (4 days after FtsQ depletion) but were longer than WT cells at later stages (10 days after FtsQ depletion) and compromised the survival in vitro and in differentiated THP1 macrophages. Overexpression of N- and C-terminal FtsQ regions altered the cell length, and the C-terminal domain alone complemented the FtsQ depletion phenotype. MS analyses suggested robust FtsQ phosphorylation on Thr-24, and although phosphoablative and -mimetic mutants rescued the FtsQ depletion--associated cell viability defects, they failed to complement the cell length defects. MS and coimmunoprecipitation experiments identified 63 FtsQ-interacting partners, and we show that the interaction of FtsQ with the recently identified cell division protein SepIVA is independent of FtsQ phosphorylation and suggests a role of FtsQ in modulating cell division. FtsQ exhibited predominantly septal localization in both the presence and absence of SepIVA. Our results suggest a role for FtsQ in modulating the length, division, and survival of Mtb cells both in vitro and in the host.},

  abstract = {In most bacteria, cell division relies on the synthesis of new cell wall material by the multiprotein divisome complex. Thus, at the core of the divisome are the transglycosylase FtsW, which synthesises peptidoglycan strands from its substrate Lipid II, and the transpeptidase FtsI that cross-links these strands to form a mesh, shaping and protecting the bacterial cell. The FtsQ--FtsB--FtsL trimeric complex interacts with the FtsWI complex and is involved in regulating its enzymatic activities; however, the structure of this pentameric complex is unknown. Here, we present the cryogenic electron microscopy structure of the FtsWIQBL complex from Pseudomonas aeruginosa at 3.7\,{\AA} resolution. Our work reveals intricate structural details, including an extended coiled coil formed by FtsL and FtsB and the periplasmic interaction site between FtsL and FtsI. Our structure explains the consequences of previously reported mutations and we postulate a possible activation mechanism involving a large conformational change in the periplasmic domain. As FtsWIQBL is central to the divisome, our structure is foundational for the design of future experiments elucidating the precise mechanism of bacterial cell division, an important antibiotic target.},

We presented a case of a household contact of rifampicin-resistant TB revealing reactive IFN-gamma release assay with unsuspicious clinical and radiologic examinations. She was diagnosed with latent tuberculosis infection (LTBI) and treated with isoniazid monotherapy. On the ninth month, she developed a progressive cough and was found to harbor active TB disease with added resistance to isoniazid. An individualized anti-TB regimen consisting of moxifloxacin, kanamycin, prothionamide, ethambutol, and pyrazinamide was prescribed for 20 months, leading to sputum culture conversion and improvement of the reported symptom. No recurrence was observed on one-year follow-up. Assuming high compliance to therapy, we propose that the patient may have been underdiagnosed and received sub-optimal treatment leading to acquired-drug resistance.

The advent of recombinant inbred mouse panels and next-generation transposon mutagenesis and sequencing approaches has enabled dissection of complex host--pathogen interactions. To identify host and pathogen genetic determinants of Mtb pathogenesis, we infected members of the highly diverse BXD family of strains with a comprehensive library of Mtb transposon mutants (TnSeq). Members of the BXD family segregate for Mtb-resistant C57BL/6J (B6 or B) and Mtb-susceptible DBA/2J (D2 or D) haplotypes. The survival of each bacterial mutant was quantified within each BXD host, and we identified those bacterial genes that were differentially required for Mtb fitness across BXD genotypes. Mutants that varied in survival among the host family of strains were leveraged as reporters of ``endophenotypes,'' each bacterial fitness profile directly probing specific components of the infection microenvironment. We conducted quantitative trait loci (QTL) mapping of these bacterial fitness endophenotypes and identified 140 host--pathogen QTL (hpQTL). We located a QTL hotspot on chromosome 6 (75.97--88.58 Mb) associated with the genetic requirement of multiple Mtb genes: Rv0127 (mak), Rv0359 (rip2), Rv0955 (perM), and Rv3849 (espR). Together, this screen reinforces the utility of bacterial mutant libraries as precise reporters of the host immunological microenvironment during infection and highlights specific host--pathogen genetic interactions for further investigation. To enable downstream follow-up for both bacterial and mammalian genetic research communities, all bacterial fitness profiles have been deposited into GeneNetwork.org and added into the comprehensive collection of TnSeq libraries in MtbTnDB.},

In E. coli FtsN activates FtsWI and a previous model posited that the essential domain of FtsN (EFtsN) acts on FtsQLB causing conformational changes so that a domain of FtsL, called AWI (AWIFtsL), contacts FtsI resulting in activation of FtsW. In this study we use genetic analysis along with an AlphaFold2 model to test this activation model. Based on our findings we propose an updated model wherein the AWIFtsL and FtsI interaction is stabilized by EFtsN to activate FtsW and that this interaction is enhanced by the CytoFtsN-FtsA interaction. Thus, FtsN acts as both a sensor for divisome assembly and an activator. In addition, we elucidate the role played by two critical FtsL residues in FtsW activation.},

  abstract = {The use of antibiotics is threatened by the emergence and spread of multidrug-resistant strains of bacteria. Thus, there is a need to develop antibiotics that address new targets. In this respect, the bacterial divisome, a multi-protein complex central to cell division, represents a potentially attractive target. Of particular interest is the FtsQB subcomplex that plays a decisive role in divisome assembly and peptidoglycan biogenesis in E. coli. Here, we report the structure-based design of a macrocyclic covalent inhibitor derived from a periplasmic region of FtsB that mediates its binding to FtsQ. The bioactive conformation of this motif was stabilized by a customized cross-link resulting in a tertiary structure mimetic with increased affinity for FtsQ. To increase activity, a covalent handle was incorporated, providing an inhibitor that impedes the interaction between FtsQ and FtsB irreversibly. The covalent inhibitor reduced the growth of an outer membrane-permeable E. coli strain, concurrent with the expected loss of FtsB localization, and also affected the infection of zebrafish larvae by a clinical E. coli strain. This first-in-class inhibitor of a divisome protein--protein interaction highlights the potential of proteomimetic molecules as inhibitors of challenging targets. In particular, the covalent mode-of-action can serve as an inspiration for future antibiotics that target protein--protein interactions.},

  abstract = {Microorganisms are often studied as populations but the behaviour of single, individual cells can have important consequences. For example, tuberculosis, caused by the bacterial pathogen Mycobacterium tuberculosis, requires months of antibiotic therapy even though the bulk of the bacterial population dies rapidly. Shorter courses lead to high rates of relapse because subpopulations of bacilli can survive despite being genetically identical to those that are easily killed. In fact, mycobacteria create variability each time a cell divides, producing daughter cells with different sizes and growth rates. The mechanism(s) that underlie this high-frequency variation and how variability relates to survival of the population are unknown. Here we show that mycobacteria actively create heterogeneity. Using a fluorescent reporter and a fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS)-based transposon screen, we find that deletion of lamA, a gene of previously unknown function, decreases heterogeneity in the population by decreasing asymmetric polar growth. LamA has no known homologues in other organisms, but is highly conserved across mycobacterial species. We find that LamA is a member of the mycobacterial division complex (the 'divisome'). It inhibits growth at nascent new poles, creating asymmetry in polar growth. The kinetics of killing individual cells that lack lamA are more uniform and more rapid with rifampicin and drugs that target the cell wall. Our results show that mycobacteria encode a non-conserved protein that controls the pattern of cell growth, resulting in a population that is both heterogeneous and better able to survive antibiotic pressure.},

  abstract = {Some microbiology experiments and biotechnology applications can be improved if it is possible to tune the expression of two different genes at the same time with cell-to-cell variation at or below the level of genes constitutively expressed from the chromosome (the ``extrinsic noise limit''). This was recently achieved for a single gene by exploiting negative autoregulation by the tetracycline repressor (TetR) and bicistronic gene expression to reduce gene expression noise. We report new plasmids that use the same principles to achieve simultaneous, low-noise expression for two genes in Escherichia coli. The TetR system was moved to a compatible plasmid backbone, and a system based on the lac repressor (LacI) was found to also exhibit gene expression noise below the extrinsic noise limit. We characterized gene expression mean and noise across the range of induction levels for these plasmids, applied the LacI system to tune expression for single-molecule mRNA detection under two different growth conditions, and showed that two plasmids can be cotransformed to independently tune expression of two different genes. IMPORTANCE Microbiologists often express foreign proteins in bacteria in order study them or to use bacteria as a microbial factory. Usually, this requires controlling the number of foreign proteins expressed in each cell, but for many common protein expression systems, it is difficult to ``tune'' protein expression without large cell-to-cell variation in expression levels (called ``noise'' in protein expression). This work describes two protein expression systems that can be combined in the same cell, with tunable expression levels and very low protein expression noise. One new system was used to detect single mRNA molecules by fluorescence microscopy, and the two systems were shown to be independent of each other. These protein expression systems may be useful in any experiment or biotechnology application that can be improved with low protein expression noise.},

  abstract = {Septation in bacteria requires coordinated regulation of cell wall biosynthesis and hydrolysis enzymes so that new septal cross-wall can be appropriately constructed without compromising the integrity of the existing cell wall. Bacteria with different modes of growth and different types of cell wall require different regulators to mediate cell growth and division processes. Mycobacteria have both a cell wall structure and a mode of growth that are distinct from well-studied model organisms and use several different regulatory mechanisms. Here, using Mycobacterium smegmatis, we identify and characterize homologs of the conserved cell division regulators FtsL and FtsB, and show that they appear to function similarly to their homologs in Escherichia coli. We identify a number of previously undescribed septally localized factors which could be involved in cell wall regulation. One of these, SepIVA, has a DivIVA domain, is required for mycobacterial septation, and is localized to the septum and the intracellular membrane domain. We propose that SepIVA is a regulator of cell wall precursor enzymes that contribute to construction of the septal cross-wall, similar to the putative elongation function of the other mycobacterial DivIVA homolog, Wag31., IMPORTANCE The enzymes that build bacterial cell walls are essential for cell survival but can cause cell lysis if misregulated; thus, their regulators are also essential. The number and nature of these regulators is likely to vary in bacteria that grow in different ways. The mycobacteria are a genus that have a cell wall whose composition and construction vary greatly from those of well-studied model organisms. In this work, we identify and characterize some of the proteins that regulate the mycobacterial cell wall. We find that some of these regulators appear to be functionally conserved with their structural homologs in evolutionarily distant species such as Escherichia coli, but other proteins have critical regulatory functions that may be unique to the actinomycetes.},
