# Example data for FtsB-PerM figure

## Plasmid loss

By chance, one field of view imaging pJRF002 and pJRF007 in standard (1 nM aTc, 100 uM IPTG) conditions showed that one microcolony had lost pJRF007. This happens occasionally given lack of antibiotics in gel pads used for the last step of growth and imaging.

We observed weak expression of mNeonGreen-PerM with some indication of membrane localizationa nd very low expression of PerM-mNeonGreen. Meanwhile, the PerMn1-mNeonGreen constructed showed much higher fluorescence, albeit without strong membrane localization. By comparison, Pf3-mNeonGreen clearly exhibits strong membrane localization. We suspected that the difference is due to PerM instability and subsequent release of a degradation product ending in mNeonGreen into the cytoplasm.
